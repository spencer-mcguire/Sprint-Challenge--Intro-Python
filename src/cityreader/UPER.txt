take csv.reader() to read csv file

assign the file to a variable, pass the variable to the reader 
assign the reader a variable to be called later 
        - csv.reader(file_name, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
        - loop the variable for the reader 
        - append the output to the cities list 

print the cities 
    - __str__ to do so or __repr__
